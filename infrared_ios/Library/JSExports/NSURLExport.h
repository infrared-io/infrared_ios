/* Resource access

 The behavior of resource value caching is slightly different between the NSURL and CFURL API.

 When the NSURL methods which get, set, or use cached resource values are used from the main thread, resource values cached by the URL (except those added as temporary properties) are removed the next time the main thread's run loop runs. -removeCachedResourceValueForKey: and -removeAllCachedResourceValues also may be used to remove cached resource values.

 The CFURL functions do not automatically remove any resource values cached by the URL. The client has complete control over the cache lifetime. If you are using CFURL API, you must use CFURLClearResourcePropertyCacheForKey or CFURLClearResourcePropertyCache to remove cached resource values.
